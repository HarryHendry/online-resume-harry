            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Harry, currently I am a freelance Web Developer based in the United Kingdom. 
                I love learning new technologies, breaking down problems and building things with my 
                newfound technical knowledge. I currently work with small businesses to showcase their 
                work online by building full stack applications.

                <p>Work with clients to build engaging and efficient Full Stack Web Applications. Technologies
